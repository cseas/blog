As a [Mozilla Rep][1], I get this question often, specially from students.

The best way to get in touch with the Mozilla developer community is through the official chat channels. Here are some to get started:

- [Firefox Desktop][2]
- [Firefox android][3]

If you'd like to volunteer for Mozilla initiatives or get in touch with local Mozillians, the community is active on Telegram:

- [Mozilla Karnataka][4]
- [Mozilla India][5]
- [Mozillians][6]
